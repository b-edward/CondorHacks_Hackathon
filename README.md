### Food Saver is a project Submission for CondorHacks Hackathon 2021, hosted by Google Developer Student Club at Conestoga College.

* When logging in, users are alerted of any items that will expire in the next 2 days.
* Items are saved to Firebase realtime database, allowing multiple users to contribute and update what is in their kitchen.
* Items are presented in a list sorted by expiration date.

### Upcoming Features:
* Register new user accounts 
* Allow multiple user accounts to share a kitchen list
* Search and filter items in list
* Add category tags
* Update reminder times
* Grocery list, automatically adding item to the kitchen list when marked as purchased
* Barcode scanning for faster entry
* Suggestions for items that have not been used after a few weeks. Use Google search to present recipes based on items already in the kitchen.
